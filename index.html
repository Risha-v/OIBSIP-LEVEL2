            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>On a tiny island bathed in the Indian sunshine, a young <span>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</span>
                dreamt of
                reaching for the stars. Born in Rameswaram in 1931, his path wasn't paved with privilege. Yet, an
                unyielding determination burned bright within him, fueling a thirst for knowledge that defied
                limitations. He devoured every scrap of wisdom, his brilliance blossoming as he earned a degree in
                aerospace engineering. This wasn't merely a career choice for Kalam; it was a clarion call, a way to
                ignite the future of his beloved nation.</p>
            <p>With a heart set on loftier goals than mere rockets, Dr. Kalam launched himself into the prestigious
                <span>Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO)</span>
                . His sights were firmly set on a horizon far
                broader – the empowerment of India's defense. Like a sculptor meticulously chiseling away at a
                masterpiece, Kalam meticulously dedicated himself to shaping the nation's missile technology. His
                leadership on projects like the SLV-III, which successfully flung satellites into the cosmos, marked a
                pivotal moment. This relentless dedication, fused with the brilliance of his scientific mind, propelled
                him to the prestigious title of <span>"Missile Man of India."</span> This wasn't just a moniker; it
                became an emblem
                of his lifelong mission – to ignite the flames of India's scientific progress and illuminate the world
                stage.</p>
